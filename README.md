🛡️ Task 1: Local Network Port ScanningThis repository documents the successful execution and analysis of a local network port scan using Nmap, demonstrating proficiency in initial network reconnaissance as required for the cybersecurity portfolio.🎯 ObjectiveThe objective of this task was to perform a fundamental security assessment of the local area network (LAN) by:Discovering all active devices (hosts).Identifying open ports on those hosts to assess network exposure and running services.💡 Key Concepts AppliedConceptExplanationPort ScanningThe process of probing a range of ports on a host to determine the state (open, closed, or filtered) and identify services running on the network.TCP SYN Scan (-sS)Chosen for its efficiency and relative stealth. It sends a SYN packet and analyzes the response (SYN/ACK means the port is open) without completing the full TCP three-way handshake.Network ReconnaissanceThe preliminary phase of cybersecurity testing where information about the target network and hosts is gathered.Open PortIndicates that an application or service is actively running and listening for connections on that specific port number.🛠️ Tools & EnvironmentPrimary Tool: Nmap (Network Mapper)Operating System: [e.g., Kali Linux VM / Windows 10 / macOS]Network Range: [e.g., 192.168.1.0/24]⚙️ Execution and CommandThe following steps were taken to execute the task:Identified Local IP: Used the ipconfig (or ip addr) command to determine the network structure.My IP: [Your PC's IP Address]Network Range: [The full network range you scanned, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24]Executed Nmap Scan: The -sS flag was used for the TCP SYN Scan across the entire local subnet.Bashnmap -sS [Your Network Range]
# Example: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
📊 Findings and Security AnalysisThe scan successfully identified active hosts and their exposed ports.Raw Nmap Output Snippet(NOTE: Paste a representative snippet of the Nmap output here. Ensure all external/public IP addresses are removed, and only the local/private IPs are shown.)Plaintext# Example Output for a Router (192.168.1.1):

443/tcp  open  https
Analysis of Key FindingsHost IPIdentified Services (Open Ports)Security Implication[e.g., 192.168.1.1]SSH (22/tcp), HTTP (80/tcp), HTTPS (443/tcp)While 443 (HTTPS) is standard, 80 (HTTP) should ideally be disabled or redirected to force encrypted traffic. SSH must have strong, non-default credentials.[e.g., 192.168.1.5]Custom Port (3306/tcp - MySQL)Exposing a database port to the entire local network is a high risk. Access should be restricted via a firewall or network segmentation to only necessary hosts.[Your PC IP]No open portsPositive finding. Indicates the system's firewall is correctly configured to block unsolicited inbound connections.ScreenshotsInclude an image file (e.g., nmap-results.png) in this repository and reference it here to visually confirm the execution.🧠 Conclusion and Lessons LearnedThis task reinforced the fundamental concept that what is open is exposed. Even within a trusted local network, every open port represents a potential entry vector.Key Lesson: Initial reconnaissance is critical. By identifying running services (like Telnet or an exposed database), security issues can be addressed proactively before they are exploited. The use of a TCP SYN Scan proved effective for rapid, low-impact host discovery.🔗 SubmissionThis repository contains the necessary documentation and raw output to meet the task requirements.Link to Repository: [This is where your instructor will get the link when you submit it.]
