# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Executive Summary
This report documents the comprehensive vulnerability assessment performed on the deployed web server. The assessment follows industry-standard methodologies and utilizes various security testing tools.

## Assessment Scope
- **Target**: Secure Web Server Deployment
- **IP Address**: [To be updated after deployment]
- **Assessment Type**: Black-box penetration testing
- **Tools Used**: Nmap, Nikto, OpenVAS, Metasploit, Burp Suite

## Vulnerability Findings

### 1. Missing HTTPS/SSL Encryption
**Severity**: HIGH  
**CVSS Score**: 7.4  
**CVE**: N/A (Configuration issue)

**Description**:
The web server is accessible only via HTTP (port 80) without SSL/TLS encryption. This allows attackers to intercept and read all data transmitted between clients and the server.

**Impact**:
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks possible
- Session hijacking
- Credential theft
- Data interception

**Proof of Concept**:
```bash
# Traffic can be intercepted using:
tcpdump -i eth0 -A host <TARGET_IP> port 80

# Or using Wireshark to capture unencrypted HTTP traffic
```

**Remediation**:
1. Obtain SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt or commercial CA)
2. Configure Nginx with SSL
3. Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
4. Enable HSTS header

**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

### 2. Information Disclosure - Server Version
**Severity**: LOW  
**CVSS Score**: 3.1  

**Description**:
The server reveals its version information in HTTP response headers, allowing attackers to identify specific vulnerabilities for that version.

**Response Headers**:
```
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
```

**Impact**:
- Facilitates targeted attacks
- Provides information for exploit development
- Reduces reconnaissance effort for attackers

**Remediation**:
```nginx
# In nginx.conf
server_tokens off;
```

**Priority**: LOW

---

### 3. SSH Port Exposed to Internet
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**CVSS Score**: 5.3  

**Description**:
SSH service (port 22) is accessible from any IP address, exposing it to brute force attacks and exploitation attempts.

**Impact**:
- Brute force password attacks
- SSH vulnerability exploitation
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Resource consumption from attack attempts

**Attack Simulation**:
```bash
# Potential brute force attack (for demonstration only):
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://<TARGET_IP>
```

**Remediation**:
1. Restrict SSH access to specific IP addresses in security group
2. Disable password authentication (key-only)
3. Implement fail2ban for automatic blocking
4. Consider using SSH on non-standard port
5. Enable two-factor authentication

**Priority**: HIGH

---

### 4. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**CVSS Score**: 5.4  

**Description**:
No Content Security Policy headers are implemented, leaving the application vulnerable to XSS and data injection attacks.

**Impact**:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Clickjacking
- Data injection
- Unauthorized resource loading

**Remediation**:
```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';";
```

**Priority**: MEDIUM

---

### 5. Missing Security Headers
**Severity**: LOW to MEDIUM  
**CVSS Score**: 4.3  

**Description**:
Several recommended security headers are missing:
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Permissions-Policy
- X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies

**Impact**:
- Reduced defense-in-depth
- Potential for protocol downgrade attacks
- Browser permission abuse

**Remediation**:
```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()";
add_header X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies "none";
```

**Priority**: MEDIUM

---

### 6. No Rate Limiting Implemented
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**CVSS Score**: 5.0  

**Description**:
The server does not implement rate limiting, making it vulnerable to brute force and denial of service attacks.

**Impact**:
- DDoS attacks
- Brute force attacks
- Resource exhaustion
- Service unavailability

**Remediation**:
```nginx
# Implement rate limiting in Nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;
limit_req zone=one burst=5;
```

**Priority**: MEDIUM

---

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: HIGH

**Risk Breakdown**:
- Critical: 1 vulnerability
- High: 1 vulnerability  
- Medium: 4 vulnerabilities
- Low: 1 vulnerability

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Automated Scanning
- Nmap for port and service discovery
- Nikto for web server vulnerabilities
- OpenVAS for comprehensive vulnerability scanning

### 2. Manual Testing
- HTTP header analysis
- SSL/TLS configuration testing
- Authentication mechanism testing
- Security header validation

### 3. Exploitation Attempts
All exploitation attempts were performed in a controlled, authorized manner on infrastructure we own.

## Compliance Considerations

### OWASP Top 10 (2021)
- A01:2021 - Broken Access Control: Partially addressed
- A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures: **VULNERABLE** (no HTTPS)
- A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration: **VULNERABLE** (missing headers)
- A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures: Partially vulnerable

### CIS Benchmarks
- Network security: Needs improvement
- Encryption: Not implemented
- Access control: Partially implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate (0-7 days)
1. ✓ Implement HTTPS with SSL certificate
2. ✓ Restrict SSH access to specific IPs
3. ✓ Enable all security headers

### Short-term (1-4 weeks)
4. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
5. Set up intrusion detection system (IDS)
6. Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
7. Implement rate limiting

### Long-term (1-3 months)
8. Regular security updates and patching schedule
9. Implement vulnerability scanning automation
10. Security awareness training
11. Disaster recovery and incident response plan

## Conclusion

The web server deployment demonstrates good baseline security with proper network segmentation and IAM policies. However, critical issues around encryption and access control need immediate attention. Following the remediation steps outlined in this report will significantly improve the security posture.
